# Example: CLI tool

CLIs are the simplest case - there's usually no background process to
manage, no ports, no lifecycle. The skill focuses on **installation**,
**representative invocations**, and **testing**.

## What matters

- **How to get the binary on `PATH`.** Installed globally? Run via
  `npx`/`uv run`? Built to `./target/release/foo`? Be explicit.
- **Two or three example invocations** that cover the main use cases.
  Include expected output so a reader can tell it worked.
- **Exit codes** if they're meaningful (e.g. linter returns 1 on findings).
- **Stdin behavior** if the tool reads from stdin.

## Example snippet

> ---
> name: run-mytool
> description: Build, install, and run mytool. Use when asked to run mytool, test it, or verify it's installed correctly.
> ---
>
> ## Setup
>
> ```bash
> pip install -e .
> ```
>
> This puts `mytool` on PATH. Verify:
>
> ```bash
> mytool --version
> # -> mytool 0.3.1
> ```
>
> ## Run
>
> Process a single file:
>
> ```bash
> mytool process input.json
> # -> Processed 42 records, wrote output.json
> ```
>
> Read from stdin, write to stdout:
>
> ```bash
> cat input.json | mytool process -
> ```
>
> Lint a directory (exits non-zero on problems):
>
> ```bash
> mytool lint ./src
> echo $?  # 0 if clean, 1 if issues found
> ```
>
> ## Test
>
> ```bash
> pytest
> ```

## Keep it short

A CLI's run skill can be very compact. Don't pad it with every flag -
the `--help` output covers that. Just show enough that an agent can
(a) build it, (b) confirm it works, (c) run the tests.


> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
