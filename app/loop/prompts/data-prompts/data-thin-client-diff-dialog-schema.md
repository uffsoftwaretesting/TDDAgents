@internal Workspace git diff for the thin-client /diff dialog. diff is null when the workspace is not a git repo or is in a transient git state (merge/rebase/cherry-pick). Paths in skippedLarge carry no hunks entry at all — membership alone marks them as too large. An entirely empty hunks array with non-empty perFileStats is not by itself a failure signal: it is the normal shape when all changes are untracked (stats only — git diff emits no hunks for untracked files) or every file was withheld, and can also occur when the hunks fetch transiently failed and only stats are available.


> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
