SEP-2243 standard `Mcp-Method` / `Mcp-Name` headers — presence, sentinel decoding, and `Mcp-Name` ↔ body cross-check — are validated by the HTTP entry on a modern-classified request after the supported-revision gate and before dispatch. The classifier’s own header-mismatch cells (protocol-version, `Mcp-Method` mismatch) stay on the edge `era-classification` rung; this rung carries the entry-layer presence/`Mcp-Name` half. Evaluated before the capability gate, the factory call, and the `Mcp-Param-*` rung so a request that fails several rungs is answered by the standard-header rung first. The documented order (after method-registry 5 and request-params 6) is NOT the observed precedence: serveModern evaluates this rung immediately after the supported-revision gate, so a request that also fails a dispatch rung is answered here before the dispatch rungs (5–6) are consulted.

These are part of the four extensibility mechanisms designed for *Capability Amplification*.



> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
