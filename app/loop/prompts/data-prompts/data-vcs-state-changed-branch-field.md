name: "Data: VCS state changed branch field"
description: "Describes the optional best-effort branch hint on vcs_state_changed events for commits and pushes, including multi-branch and uncertain-attribution behavior"
type: "data-prompts"
---

The branch a commit landed on (from the commit summary line git prints per commit) or a push updated (from the ref-update line git prints per pushed ref, e.g. `HEAD -> other`). Commit and push events carry it; a command that pushed several branches emits one push event per branch. A best-effort hint: absent whenever attribution is uncertain (a push whose output was redirected still emits, with no branch; a push that also updated a ref whose name could not be carried emits a nameless event beside the named ones), and never a required key.


> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
