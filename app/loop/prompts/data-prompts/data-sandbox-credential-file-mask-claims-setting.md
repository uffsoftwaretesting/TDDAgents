description: "Describes sandbox credential file maskClaims behavior for selectively masking decoded JWT payload claims while preserving other claims"
type: "data-prompts"
---

Names of top-level payload claims to mask inside each decoded value, instead of replacing the whole token. Each named claim present with a string value gets its own sentinel and the token is rebuilt around the modified payload; all other claims are preserved so a tool that decodes the token and reads a non-secret claim keeps working. Requires `decode`. If no named claim matches in any verified token, behavior is governed by `onExtractNoMatch` (default `warn`). Only meaningful when mode is `mask`; accepted but ignored for `deny`.


> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
