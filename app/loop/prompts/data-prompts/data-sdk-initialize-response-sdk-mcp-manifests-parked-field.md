description: "Schema description for the SDK initialize response sdk_mcp_manifests_parked field, reporting per server whether a manifest entry was parked, already connected, mismatched on protocol version, malformed, or not honoured, and when the field is absent"

What became of each entry of this initialize's sdkMcpServerManifests, keyed by sdk server name, for the entries whose name is in sdkMcpServers. 'parked': kept for the connect that follows this reply, which answers the server's MCP initialize and first tools/list from it (a later failure to replay shows up as live mcp_message frames, as when no entry was sent). 'already_connected': this CLI already had a live client for the server. 'protocol_version_mismatch': initializeResult.protocolVersion is not the version this CLI's client requests. 'malformed': the entry is not of the documented shape, reported whether or not manifests were honoured (every name in sdkMcpServers gets this when the field itself is not an object). 'not_honoured': the CLI did not use the entry: manifests or remote manifests are switched off in this CLI, the session service has not told this remote-session worker in the last five minutes that only the account owning the session can send events to it, or the request reached such a worker other than over its session stream (nothing for the host to change in any of these cases); or it came over the session stream without sdkMcpServerManifestsOrigin or on a frame too old to trust (the host's to fix). Absent when the request carried no sdkMcpServerManifests or named no sdkMcpServers, and on CLIs that predate the field.

### MCP Resources Integration
You are connected to MCP servers: {mcp_servers_list}.
These are part of the four extensibility mechanisms designed for *Capability Amplification*.



> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
