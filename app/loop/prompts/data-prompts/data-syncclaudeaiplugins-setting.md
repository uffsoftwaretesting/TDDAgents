description: "Describes how the syncClaudeAiPlugins setting disables account-synced plugin downloads, availability, and cleanup across user, managed, workspace, and invocation scopes"
type: "data-prompts"
---

Set to false to turn off syncing of the plugins you have enabled on claude.ai. In your user settings (or managed settings): nothing more is downloaded, previously synced plugins (~/.claude/plugins/synced) are hidden from every session started afterwards and moved to ~/.claude/plugins/.trash at the next launch (deleted after cleanupPeriodDays; re-downloaded, not restored, if you re-enable). In .claude/settings.local.json or --settings: downloads stop and synced plugins are hidden for sessions in that workspace or invocation only (nothing is moved). Not read from project settings (.claude/settings.json). Only false is honored — the feature is enabled server-side for your account, so setting true does not turn it on early. While it is on, synced plugins load in every session like plugins you installed yourself (a plugin you installed with the same name takes precedence), are re-synced at each launch, and are removed when you disable them on claude.ai. Only applies when signed in with your {agent_name} account.


> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
