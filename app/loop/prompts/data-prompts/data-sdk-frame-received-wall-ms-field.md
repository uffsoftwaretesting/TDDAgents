description: "Schema description for the SDK turn-timing frame_received_wall_ms field recording when the triggering send's frame arrived on a session reading input from the session server's SSE stream, how it pairs with the enqueue and turn-start timestamps to split transit from queue wait, and when it is absent"
type: "data-prompts"

@internal Date.now() (epoch ms) when the triggering send's frame arrived on a session reading its input from the session server's SSE stream (--sdk-url), before the input loop read it. With frame_enqueued_wall_ms and turn_started_wall_ms it splits the stretch between the server's persist and request_sent_wall_ms into transit, the input loop's handling of the frame, its wait on the command queue, and the turn's own work. Present only together with request_sent_wall_ms, and only when the transport recorded the receipt; absent on a local stdin host and from older producers.


> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
