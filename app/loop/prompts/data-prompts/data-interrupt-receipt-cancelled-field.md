name: "Data: Interrupt receipt cancelled field"
description: "Schema description for the cancelled UUID list returned when an interrupt request cancels queued commands"
type: "data-prompts"
---

Present only when the request set cancel_queued:true — uuids of main-thread commands cancelled by this interrupt: every survivor that would otherwise have appeared under `still_queued`, including any uuid that was mid-fold at the interrupt instant (this request also aborts, so the fold never delivers it). Each listed uuid has been removed (queue-resident) or marked cancel-pending (the first-command prewait window, closed by the drain loop's backstop) and emits a terminal 'cancelled' lifecycle synchronously at the first such interrupt (a repeat interrupt over the same parked batch re-lists the uuid idempotently without re-emitting); none will run. Same coverage caveats as `still_queued` (uuid-stamped main-thread only; internally-enqueued uuids may appear). Advertised by the `interrupt_cancel_queued_v1` capability.


> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
