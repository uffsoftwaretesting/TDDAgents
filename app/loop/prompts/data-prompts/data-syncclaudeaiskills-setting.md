description: "Describes how the syncClaudeAiSkills setting disables account-synced skill downloads, availability, and cleanup across user, managed, workspace, and invocation scopes"
type: "data-prompts"

Set to false to turn off syncing of the skills you have enabled on claude.ai. In your user settings (or managed settings): nothing more is downloaded, previously synced skills (~/.claude/skills/synced) can no longer be run, are hidden from every session started afterwards, and are moved to ~/.claude/skills/.trash at the next launch (deleted after cleanupPeriodDays; re-downloaded, not restored, if you re-enable). In .claude/settings.local.json or --settings: downloads stop and synced skills are blocked and hidden for sessions in that workspace or invocation only (nothing is moved). Not read from project settings (.claude/settings.json). Only false is honored — the feature is enabled server-side for your account, so setting true does not turn it on early. While it is on, synced skills are available in every session, re-synced every 10 minutes, and removed when you disable them on claude.ai. Only applies when signed in with your {agent_name} account.


> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
