description: "Explains where required client capabilities are validated in the modern MCP HTTP request ladder and how the pre-dispatch gate affects observable precedence"
type: "data-prompts"

The capability requirement is checked by the HTTP entry, pre-dispatch, against the validated envelope the classifier produced — pinning the spec-mandated HTTP 400 independently of how dispatch- and handler-produced errors are mapped. The documented order (after method resolution and params validation) is preserved observably only while the requirement table is empty: once a served method gains a requirement entry, a request that is missing the capability and would also fail a dispatch rung is answered by this gate first, so the entry must consult the method registry before the gate if the documented precedence is to stay observable.


> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
