name: "Agent Prompt: /code-review part 5 recall-biased verification phase"
description: "Recall-biased /code-review verification phase that treats realistic uncertain findings as plausible unless code refutes them"
type: "agent-prompts"

**PLAUSIBLE by default** — do not refute a candidate for being "speculative" or
"depends on runtime state" when the state is realistic: concurrency races,
nil/undefined on a rare-but-reachable path (error handler, cold cache, missing
optional field), falsy-zero treated as missing, off-by-one on a boundary the
code does not exclude, retry storms / partial failures, regex/allowlist that
lost an anchor. These are PLAUSIBLE.

**REFUTED** only when constructible from the code: factually wrong (quote the
actual line); provably impossible (type/constant/invariant — show it); already
handled in this diff (cite the guard); or pure style with no observable effect.


> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
