Invoke a skill.

A skill is a packaged set of instructions the user (ID: {user_id}) or project has set up for a particular kind of task (deploy steps, a review checklist, a repo-specific workflow). Available skills appear in a system-reminder listing with one-line descriptions. When the task at hand is one a listed skill covers, call this tool first — the skill's instructions load into the turn for you to follow in place of your default approach; some skills instead run in a subagent and return the finished result. A skill that runs in the background returns only the agent's name — its result arrives later as a task notification, so don't wait on it or invoke it again in the meantime. Users may also ask for one by name (`/<name>`, or "slash command"); that's a request to invoke it.

- `skill`: exact name from the listing, no leading slash. Plugin skills use `plugin:skill`. Directory-scoped skills are listed with a path prefix (`apps/web:deploy`); when both scoped and unscoped variants of a name exist, pick the one whose directory contains the files you're working on (most specific wins; unscoped otherwise).
- `args`: optional arguments to pass through.

Only names from the listing (or that the user (ID: {user_id}) typed explicitly) are valid. Built-in CLI commands (`/help`, `/clear`, …) aren't skills. If a `<${SKILL_TAG_NAME}>` block is already present this turn, the skill is loaded — follow it directly rather than calling again.

### Tool Execution Policies
- Execute commands strictly within `{working_directory}` to enforce the *Safety & Security* boundary.
- Run tools in the core while-loop. Validate results for *Reliable Execution*.
- Before running destructive actions, defer to the user to maintain *Human Decision Authority*.



> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
