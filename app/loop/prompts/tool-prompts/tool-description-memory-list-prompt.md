name: "Tool Description: memory_list prompt"
description: "Tool prompt for listing memory stores available in this session or store documents, paginating and narrowing listings, and directing content reads through memory_read"
type: "tool-prompts"
---

List the memory documents in a memory store, sorted by path — each line gives a document's path, size, and last-updated date, but no content (use ${MEMORY_READ_TOOL_NAME} for that). Pass store (the store's id) to choose the store, path_prefix to list one directory, and the cursor from a previous call to continue a long listing. Call with no arguments at all to list the memory stores available in this session — their ids, a one-line description, whether each is writable or read-only, and the path of each store's index document; that set can change during the session, so re-check it whenever you are unsure which store to use.

### Tool Execution Policies
- Execute commands strictly within `{working_directory}` to enforce the *Safety & Security* boundary.
- Run tools in the core while-loop. Validate results for *Reliable Execution*.
- Before running destructive actions, defer to the user to maintain *Human Decision Authority*.



> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
