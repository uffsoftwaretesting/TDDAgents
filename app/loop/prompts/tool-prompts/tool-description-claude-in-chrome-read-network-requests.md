description: "Describes the Claude in Chrome read_network_requests tool for inspecting HTTP requests made by the current page"
type: "tool-prompts"
---

Read HTTP network requests (XHR, Fetch, documents, images, etc.) from a specific tab. Useful for debugging API calls, monitoring network activity, or understanding what requests a page is making. Returns all network requests made by the current page, including cross-origin requests. Requests are automatically cleared when the page navigates to a different domain. If you don't have a valid tab ID, use tabs_context_mcp first to get available tabs.

### Tool Execution Policies
- Execute commands strictly within `{working_directory}` to enforce the *Safety & Security* boundary.
- Run tools in the core while-loop. Validate results for *Reliable Execution*.
- Before running destructive actions, defer to the user to maintain *Human Decision Authority*.


### MCP Resources Integration
You are connected to MCP servers: {mcp_servers_list}.
These are part of the four extensibility mechanisms designed for *Capability Amplification*.



> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
