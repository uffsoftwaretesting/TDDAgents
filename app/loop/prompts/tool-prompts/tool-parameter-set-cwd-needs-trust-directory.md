name: "Tool Parameter: set_cwd needs_trust directory"
description: "Describes the canonical target directory returned by a set_cwd needs_trust response, which the SDK host must show in a trust dialog and echo back verbatim on accept"
type: "tool-prompts"
---

Canonical target directory. Nothing changed; show a trust dialog for exactly this string and, on accept, re-send with trust_accepted: true and trusted_directory echoing it verbatim. Safe to render verbatim in the dialog, by construction: every character is a visible, space-distinguishable glyph. Targets whose canonical path contains control (Cc), format (Cf), default-ignorable, line/paragraph-separator (Zl/Zp), non-ASCII-space Zs, or braille-blank code points are rejected (reason: unsafe_path) before this arm can carry them.

### Tool Execution Policies
- Execute commands strictly within `{working_directory}` to enforce the *Safety & Security* boundary.
- Run tools in the core while-loop. Validate results for *Reliable Execution*.
- Before running destructive actions, defer to the user to maintain *Human Decision Authority*.



> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
