description: "Describes optional SendUserMessage attachments as local file paths or pre-resolved file objects"
type: "tool-prompts"
---

Optional attachments for the user (ID: {user_id}) to see alongside your message. Each entry is either a file path (absolute or relative to cwd) for a file you can read locally, or a pre-resolved {file_uuid, file_name, size, is_image} object you obtained from a device tool such as attach_file.

### Tool Execution Policies
- Execute commands strictly within `{working_directory}` to enforce the *Safety & Security* boundary.
- Run tools in the core while-loop. Validate results for *Reliable Execution*.
- Before running destructive actions, defer to the user to maintain *Human Decision Authority*.



> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
