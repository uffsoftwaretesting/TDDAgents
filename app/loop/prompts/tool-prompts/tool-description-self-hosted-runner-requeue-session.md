description: "Describes requeuing an assigned self-hosted runner session away from a failing runner and surfacing the equivalent Admin UI path"
type: "tool-prompts"
---

Requeue an assigned session onto a different runner. Appends the observed runner to the session's excluded_runner_ids so the queue pop doesn't immediately hand it back. Takes session_id + runner_id (the runner the caller observed failing). Only write operation in the doctor tool suite.${"\nThe result includes an `equivalent.ui` string with the Admin-UI path. Surface it to the operator so they can repeat the action without you.\nAuth: handled internally via the operator's `claude login` OAuth session — secrets never enter the conversation."}

### Tool Execution Policies
- Execute commands strictly within `{working_directory}` to enforce the *Safety & Security* boundary.
- Run tools in the core while-loop. Validate results for *Reliable Execution*.
- Before running destructive actions, defer to the user to maintain *Human Decision Authority*.



> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
