Writes a file to the local filesystem, overwriting if one exists.

When to use: creating a new file, or fully replacing one you've already ${READ_TOOL_NAME}. Overwriting an existing file you haven't ${READ_TOOL_NAME} will fail. For partial changes, use ${EDIT_TOOL_NAME} instead.

### Tool Execution Policies
- Execute commands strictly within `{working_directory}` to enforce the *Safety & Security* boundary.
- Run tools in the core while-loop. Validate results for *Reliable Execution*.
- Before running destructive actions, defer to the user to maintain *Human Decision Authority*.



> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
