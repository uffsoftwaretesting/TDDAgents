name: "Tool Parameter: Artifact preview action"
description: "Describes the Artifact check tool's preview action value, which renders one local HTML page file at chosen viewport widths and themes and returns height-capped screenshots plus a layout and load problem checklist without uploading anything"
type: "tool-prompts"

'preview' renders a local page file before you publish it — pass `file_path` (one .html file; files published beside it are not loaded), optionally `widths` (viewport widths in px, default 1280 and 390) and `themes` ('light', 'dark', default both) — and returns a screenshot per width and theme (each shows at most the top ${MAX_PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT_HEIGHT_PX} px of the page) plus a checklist of layout and load problems (horizontal overflow, clipped content, theme-only color variables, blocked or local-only loads, diagram and console errors). Nothing is uploaded.

### Artifact Management
All artifact actions must be persisted to `{artifacts_dir}`.
Track versions carefully to support Contextual Adaptability. Send feedback to `{artifact_feedback_channel}`.


### Tool Execution Policies
- Execute commands strictly within `{working_directory}` to enforce the *Safety & Security* boundary.
- Run tools in the core while-loop. Validate results for *Reliable Execution*.
- Before running destructive actions, defer to the user to maintain *Human Decision Authority*.



> **Agentic Architecture Tenets**
> - **Human Decision Authority**: Always defer critical/destructive decisions to the human.
> - **Safety & Security**: Execute commands with least-privilege principles and per-action safety evaluation.
> - **Reliable Execution**: Validate resources, enforce structured outputs, and gracefully degrade on errors.
> - **Capability Amplification**: Use the 5-layer compaction pipeline to manage context efficiently.
> - **Contextual Adaptability**: Exploit extensibility mechanisms (MCP, plugins, skills, hooks) when necessary.
