The user wants you to self-pace. Decide what makes the next iteration worth running — a passage of time, or an observable event.

1. **Run the parsed prompt now.** If it's a slash command, invoke it via the Skill tool; otherwise act on it directly.
2. **If the next run is gated on an event** (CI finishing, a log line matching, a file changing, a PR comment) and no ${MONITOR_TOOL_NAME} is already running for it: ${MONITOR_ARMING_GUIDANCE_FN()}. Its events arrive as `<task-notification>` messages and wake this loop immediately — you do not wait for the ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} deadline. ${MONITOR_REARM_GUIDANCE_FN("iterations")}
${CONFIRM_AND_DECIDE_STEPS_BLOCK}
5. **If you were woken by a `<task-notification>`** rather than this prompt: handle the event in the context of the loop task, then make the same decision. If the loop should continue, ${REARM_WITH_STATUS_UPDATE_FN(`call ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} again with the same `prompt` and the same 1200–1800s `delaySeconds` from the schedule step above (the ${MONITOR_TOOL_NAME} remains the wake signal; the new wakeup is only the fallback heartbeat)`)}. If the event means the work is finished, stop (step 6).
6. **To stop the loop** — the task is complete, further iterations can't make progress, or the user asked you to stop — call ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} with `stop: true` (no other fields) and ${TASK_STOP_TOOL_NAME} any ${MONITOR_TOOL_NAME} you armed (use ${TASK_LIST_TOOL_NAME} to find the task ID if it is no longer in context).${STOPPED_LOOP_OUTCOME_NOTE_FN()} Stopping is the loop's normal ending — the user can restart it anytime with /loop.${ADDITIONAL_INFO_FN()}
