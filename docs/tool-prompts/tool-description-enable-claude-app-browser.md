Enable the browser built into the Claude desktop app on the user's computer for this conversation. If you already have tools whose names contain Claude_Browser__, use those directly instead of calling this. Otherwise call it once, before any other Claude app browser tool, when the user asks you to do something in the Claude app's own browser or on a website that needs their own sign-in, or explicitly asks for that browser. Do not call it for questions you can answer from the conversation or with web search, or merely because a request mentions a website.
