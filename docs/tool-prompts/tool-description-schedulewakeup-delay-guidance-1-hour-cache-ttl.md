## Picking delaySeconds

This session's requests use a 1-hour Anthropic prompt-cache TTL, so effectively every allowed delay (the runtime clamps to [60, 3600]) wakes up with your conversation context still cached. There is no cache cliff inside that range to pace around, and scheduling extra wakeups just to keep the cache warm is pure waste — never do that. (If the session enters usage overage, later requests drop to the 5-minute TTL; don't try to track or preempt that — the guidance here stays the same.)

Match the delay to what you're actually waiting for:

- **Actively polling external state the harness can't notify you about** (a CI run, a deploy, a remote queue): pick the delay from how fast that state actually changes. A CI run that takes ~8 minutes deserves one ~480s check, not eight 60s ones.
- **The long fallback heartbeat** (something else — a Monitor, a task notification — is the primary wake signal): 1200s+, so quiet wakeups stay rare.
- **Idle ticks with no specific signal to watch**: default to **1200s–1800s** (20–30 min). The loop still checks back regularly, and the user can always interrupt if they need you sooner.

Don't think in cache windows — think about what you're actually waiting for.
